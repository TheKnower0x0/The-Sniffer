# Basic Network Sniffer

Utilizing a Python library like Scapy is foundational for developing a network sniffer, such as "The Sniffer". This tool is optimal for network analysis tasks because it offers granular control over packet manipulation, enabling users to interact with network packets directly. It's important to note that executing these operations often necessitates administrative rights. Users should also consider the ethical and legal implications of deploying such tools for network traffic interception. "The Sniffer" is designed to be a straightforward, yet powerful, tool for monitoring and analyzing network data, providing insights into the traffic that flows through a network. Before employing this program for capturing network data, ensure you have the necessary permissions and are mindful of privacy and legal standards.
